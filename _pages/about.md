As an aspiring data scientist with a strong foundation in business analytics, I aim to leverage my analytical and financial skills to drive success. My journey began with a **Bachelor's degree in Business Administration** from the University of Washington, and I'm currently pursuing a **Master of Science in Data Science** at Southern Methodist University, maintaining a perfect GPA. My technical proficiency spans **Python, R, SQL, and TensorFlow**, complemented by certifications in **AI** from Harvard and **Excel Skills for Business** from JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs.

I am currently working as a graduate study researcher and teaching assistant.

I bring a unique blend of technical expertise, business acumen, and a passion for data-driven solutions, eager to make a significant impact in the field of data science.
